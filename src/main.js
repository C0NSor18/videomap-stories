// either be an actual component constructor created via
// `Vue.extend()`, or just a component options object.
// We'll talk about nested routes later.
const routes = [
  { path: '/stories/:id', component: Story, name: 'story' },

// 3. Create the router instance and pass the `routes` option
// You can pass in additional options here, but let's
// keep it simple for now.

    routes // short for `routes: routes`
})


new Vue({
  router,
  vuetify,
  render: h => h(App)
